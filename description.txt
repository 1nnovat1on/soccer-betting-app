Here’s what you should send the dev team as a **single “Build Spec”** for BLITZR (Python Flask + HTML). It’s written to turn your ideas into **requirements, screens, data, and tasks**.

---

## 1) One-sentence product definition

**BLITZR = World Cup–focused soccer betting app where users pick (Win/Lose/Tie) per match and stake $0–$100, with live-updating potential payout.**

**MVP goal:** get from QR login → ID check → wallet funded → place bet → see bet slip + outcomes/payouts → settle.

---

## 2) MVP scope (what we are building first)

### Core flows (must work end-to-end)

1. **QR Code Login / Account Start**

* Landing page shows QR code (or “Scan to login” concept)
* If web-only MVP: QR can deep-link to `/login` with token OR just be a “fast login” gimmick for now

2. **User Registration + Auth**

* Username, password (hashed), email/phone optional
* Sessions/JWT (decide one)
* Password reset (basic)

3. **ID Check (KYC)**

* A “KYC status” gate before enabling deposits/withdrawals and placing bets
* Start with a stub flow (upload ID selfie + ID image) OR integrate a KYC vendor later
* States: `NOT_STARTED / PENDING / VERIFIED / REJECTED`

4. **Wallet (Deposits/Withdrawals)**

* For MVP, choose:

  * **Option A (fastest):** “play money” wallet (demo) to validate product
  * **Option B:** real payments via Stripe-like provider
  * **Option C:** crypto payments (phase 2 unless you already have infra)
* Always track a ledger (append-only transactions)

5. **Matches List (World Cup focus)**

* Show upcoming matches grouped: **Group A, Group B, …**
* Each match card: teams, kickoff time (local), status, basic odds or implied payout

6. **Bet Placement**

* Bet type for MVP: **Match Result = WIN/LOSE/TIE**
* Stake: **$0–$100** slider/input
* User picks exactly one outcome per match
* Show “Potential Return” that updates instantly

7. **My Bets**

* View open bets, settled bets, returns
* Status: `OPEN / WON / LOST / PUSH / VOID / CANCELED`

8. **Settlement**

* Pull final scores from SportRadar
* Automatically settle bets (background job)

---

## 3) Phase 2+ (explicitly out of MVP)

* Parlays, handicap, props, live betting
* Social features, referral codes, bonuses
* Streaming
* Crypto deposits/withdrawals (unless you pick it for MVP)
* “Wild Card” categories (best upcoming star / biggest shocker) — likely needs custom markets + rules + settlement logic

---

## 4) Screens & UI requirements (what dev should build)

### Pages (web)

1. **Landing / QR Login**
2. **Register**
3. **Login**
4. **KYC (ID Check)**
5. **Wallet**

   * Balance, deposit, withdraw, transaction history
6. **Matches**

   * Tabs: Groups A–H (or tournament stages)
   * Match card → bet modal
7. **Bet Slip / Confirm**
8. **My Bets**
9. **Admin (internal)**

   * Manage matches cache, view users, KYC status overrides (if allowed), manual settlement tools, audit logs

### UI rules

* Mobile-first responsive HTML
* Fast: pages should load in <2s on average
* Clear states: “KYC required”, “Insufficient funds”, “Bet locked after kickoff”
* Live updating “Potential Return” (client-side calc)

---

## 5) Betting + payout logic (dev needs this clarified)

You must choose **one** of these models for MVP:

### Model 1: “Fixed payout multiplier” (simplest)

* Each outcome has a multiplier (e.g., Win 1.8x, Tie 3.2x, Lose 2.4x)
* Return = stake * multiplier
* Multipliers come from SportRadar odds (or your own simple rules)

### Model 2: “Points / leaderboard” (if avoiding real-money complexity early)

* Stake is points (0–100)
* Earn points based on correctness + upset bonus
* Great for MVP demo + avoids payments/legal complexity until later

**Tell dev team which one you want for MVP.** If you don’t decide, they can’t implement settlement correctly.

---

## 6) Data + API integration (SportRadar)

### What we pull

* Tournament schedule (World Cup)
* Match status + kickoff times
* Odds (if available under your plan)
* Final results for settlement

### What we store (cache locally)

* `matches` table with SportRadar IDs
* `teams` table
* `odds` table (versioned snapshots recommended)
* Don’t call SportRadar on every page load—use a cache + refresh job

### Update cadence

* Schedule refresh: every 6–12 hours
* Upcoming match status: every 1–5 minutes (more frequently near kickoff)
* Settlement check: every 1–5 minutes for matches in “complete” state

---

## 7) Backend architecture (Flask)

### Recommended structure

* Flask app + Blueprints (`auth`, `kyc`, `wallet`, `matches`, `bets`, `admin`)
* DB: Postgres (preferred) or MySQL
* ORM: SQLAlchemy
* Migrations: Alembic
* Background jobs: Celery + Redis (or RQ) for odds refresh + settlement
* Templates: Jinja2 for MVP (or keep HTML simple + fetch JSON endpoints)

### Key endpoints (example)

* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `POST /api/auth/login`
* `GET /api/matches?group=A`
* `POST /api/bets` (match_id, outcome, stake)
* `GET /api/bets/mine`
* `POST /api/wallet/deposit` (MVP: fake or provider)
* `POST /api/wallet/withdraw`
* `POST /api/kyc/submit`
* `GET /api/kyc/status`

---

## 8) Database tables (minimum)

* `users` (id, username, password_hash, created_at, last_login)
* `kyc` (user_id, status, submitted_at, verified_at, metadata_json)
* `wallet_accounts` (user_id, currency, balance_cached)
* `wallet_ledger` (id, user_id, type, amount, created_at, reference, status)
* `matches` (id, sportradar_id, group, home_team, away_team, kickoff, status, score_json)
* `odds_snapshots` (id, match_id, captured_at, odds_json)
* `bets` (id, user_id, match_id, outcome, stake, potential_return, placed_at, status, settled_at, payout)

**Important:** wallet must be ledger-based to avoid “balance desync” nightmares.

---

## 9) Security & integrity requirements

* Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2), never plain text
* Rate limiting on auth endpoints
* Input validation everywhere
* Audit logs for: deposits, withdrawals, bet placement, settlement actions
* Prevent betting after kickoff (server-side enforcement)
* Anti-tamper: potential_return should be recomputed server-side on bet placement

---

## 10) Compliance / legal (what dev needs to build, not legal advice)

Even if legal is handled by counsel, engineering should support:

* Age gate + KYC status gate
* Responsible gambling hooks (phase 2):

  * deposit limits, cooling-off, self-exclusion
* Clear Terms/Privacy placeholders in UI
* Region gating capability (IP-based) if required later

*(You’ll want a lawyer for licensing/jurisdiction. Dev team just needs the app to support these constraints.)*

---

## 11) Team deliverables & workflow

### Deliverables

* Repo with:

  * Flask backend
  * HTML templates (or static frontend) + minimal JS
  * Docker setup
  * DB migrations
  * Seed script for tournament/groups
* Environments:

  * local dev
  * staging
  * production

### Definition of done (MVP)

* A new user can:

  1. create account
  2. complete KYC (or be marked verified in demo)
  3. deposit funds (demo or real)
  4. place a bet (win/lose/tie, $0–$100)
  5. see “my bets”
  6. after match completes, bet auto-settles and wallet updates

---

## 12) Open decisions you must answer (so devs don’t guess)

Send these as “product decisions”:

1. **Real money or demo points for MVP?**
2. **Odds source:** SportRadar odds (if included) vs your own fixed multipliers?
3. **Payout model:** fixed multiplier vs points/leaderboard?
4. **QR login:** real QR-based auth or just a marketing entry screen for now?
5. **KYC:** stub upload vs integrate vendor now?
6. **Geography:** where will this run (even if “demo only”)?

If you answer those 6, dev team can execute cleanly.

---

If you want, paste your answers to those 6 decisions and I’ll turn this into a **one-page PRD** + a **Jira-ready task breakdown** (epics → stories → acceptance criteria) tailored to your exact MVP choice.
